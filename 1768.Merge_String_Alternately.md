# Problem
You are given two strings word1 and word2. Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1. If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Return the merged string.

 

Example 1:

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "pqr"
Output: "apbqcr"
Explanation: The merged string will be merged as so:
word1:  a   b   c
word2:    p   q   r
merged: a p b q c r
Example 2:

Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "pqrs"
Output: "apbqrs"
Explanation: Notice that as word2 is longer, "rs" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b 
word2:    p   q   r   s
merged: a p b q   r   s
Example 3:

Input: word1 = "abcd", word2 = "pq"
Output: "apbqcd"
Explanation: Notice that as word1 is longer, "cd" is appended to the end.
word1:  a   b   c   d
word2:    p   q 
merged: a p b q c   d
 

Constraints:

1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 100
word1 and word2 consist of lowercase English letters


# Language of Choice
C++

# Solution
This problem was relatively strightforward as can be seen from the difficulty (It is easy). The phrase 'Adding letters in alternating order' simply means to add each letter of both words one at a time.
Below is a my code. I have not yet calculated the time or space complexity

``` C++

class Solution {
public:
    //0 for word 1, and 1 word word 2 (which one is larger)
    int smallerStringLength = 0;
    void min(int a, int b){
        if(a > b){
            smallerStringLength = 1;
            return;
        }
        // no need to do anything for word 1 as it is already 0
    }
    string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
        //check if bopth stringd are equal
        bool equalLength = false;
        if(word1.size() == word2.size()){
            //both string sare equal
            equalLength = true;
        }

        std::string res;
        if(equalLength){
            res.reserve(word1.size());
        }
        else{
            res.reserve(word1.size()+word2.size());
        }
        
        
        if(equalLength){
            //if strings are equal start with word 1
            for(int i=0; i<word1.size();i++){
                res.push_back(word1.at(i));// = word1.at(i);
                std::cout <<res[i]<<std::endl;
                //for(int" j=i;j<j+1;j++){
                res.push_back(word2.at(i));// = word2.at(i);
                std::cout <<res[i+1]<<std::endl;
                //}
            }
            std::cout<<res<<std::endl;
            return res;
        }

        //if strings are not equal
        min(word1.size(),word2.size());
        if(smallerStringLength){ //block will run meaning word2 is smaller length
            int remaining = 0;
            for(int i=0; i<word2.size();i++){
                res.push_back(word1.at(i));
                res.push_back(word2.at(i));
                remaining = i+1;
            }
            res+=word1.substr(remaining);
            return res;
        }

        if(!(smallerStringLength)){ //block will run meaning word1 is smaller length
            int remaining = 0;
            for(int i=0; i<word1.size();i++){
                res.push_back(word1.at(i));
                res.push_back(word2.at(i));
                remaining = (i+1);
            }
            res+=word2.substr(remaining);
        }
        return res;
    }
};
 
```
